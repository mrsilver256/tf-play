Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there lived a king who was loved by all his people. The king was wise and kind, always making fair decisions for the benefit of his kingdom.

One day, a mysterious traveler arrived at the castle. The traveler spoke of distant lands and strange adventures. Intrigued by the tales, the king invited the traveler to stay at the castle and share more stories.

As days turned into weeks, the traveler and the king became good friends. The traveler taught the king many things about the world beyond the kingdom's borders. The king, in turn, shared his wisdom about ruling justly and fairly.

The people of the kingdom admired the king even more for his newfound knowledge and the changes he made to better their lives. And so, the kingdom prospered, thanks to the wisdom of the king and the tales of the mysterious traveler.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

  Why do we use it?
  It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less shit normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).
  
  
  Where does it come from?
  Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
  
  The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

United States Vice President Kamala Harris has pledged not to stay “silent” about suffering in Gaza, shifting emphasis to the plight of Palestinians as the de facto presidential nominee walks a fine line on the conflict dividing her Democratic Party.

Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington on Thursday, Harris said that her commitment to Israel’s existence and security was “unwavering”, but that “far too many” innocent civilians had been killed in the war.

“What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating. The images of dead children and desperate, hungry people fleeing for safety, sometimes displaced for the second, third or fourth time,” Harris said.

“We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies. We cannot allow ourselves to become numb to the suffering. And I will not be silent.”

Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden’s decision to end his re-election campaign, said that she had urged Netanyahu to agree to a US-backed ceasefire proposal.

“It is time for this war to end and end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity and self-determination,” Harris said.

Harris also reiterated her support for Israel’s right to defend itself, condemned Hamas as a “brutal terrorist organisation”, and listed the names of five US citizens believed to be in Hamas’s captivity in Gaza as well as the names of two others whose remains are believed to be in the enclave.

“I have met with the families of these American hostages multiple times now, and I have told each time they are not alone and I stand with them, and President Biden and I are working every day to bring them home,” she said.

In a nod to divisions over Israel and Gaza, Harris also called on Americans to acknowledge the “complexity” and “nuance” of the conflict.

“Too often, the conversation is binary, when the reality is anything but,” Harris said.

While Harris’s remarks did not point to substantive policy differences with Biden, her forceful invocation of Palestinians’ suffering drew a contrast with her boss’s more subdued, mostly back-channel efforts to restrain Israel.

Biden’s policy on Gaza has alienated progressive factions of the Democratic Party as well as many Muslim-Americans, a large number of whom live in Michigan, a key swing state that is considered crucial to the outcome of November’s election.

Al Jazeera’s Patty Culhane, reporting from Washington, said that Harris spent more time speaking about the suffering of Palestinians than Biden has, even as she sought to bolster her credentials as a pro-Israel figure.

“She talked about the number of starvations. The number of people who are food insecure. The number of people who have had to move several times. She talked about seeing pictures of dead children,” Culhane said.

“You don’t see that in the US media. You don’t see it on the front pages of newspapers. Almost hardly at all. There is very little discussion about the plight of the people in Gaza.”

While Harris positioned herself to the left of Biden during her failed 2020 presidential run, she has a long track record of strong support for Israel.

After entering the US Senate in 2017, her first overseas trip was to Israel and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a United Nations Security Council resolution condemning the country.

Harris also spoke at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s (AIPAC) annual convention that year, telling the audience that the bonds between the US and Israel were “unbreakable” and “we can never let anyone drive a wedge between us”.

In an interview with the Israeli news site Ynet published on Tuesday, Israel’s ambassador to the US, Michael Herzog, said Harris’s overall record was “positive”, but she had made “quite a few problematic statements” about the war in Gaza.
